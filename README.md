## ‚å®Ô∏è What is Powershell-Empire? 

* Powershell-Empire was an open-source post-exploitation agent that ran through Windows Powershell.
* It allowed for a user to generate attack scripts for use against other Windows machines, MacOS, or Linux subsystems.
* It is not offically maintained as of August of 2019, but a fork was used as a base for the creation of this cybersecurity excercise.
