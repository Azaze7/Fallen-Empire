## ‚å®Ô∏è What is Powershell-Empire? 

* Powershell-Empire was an open-source post-exploitation agent that ran through Windows Powershell.
* It allowed for a user to generate attack scripts for use against other Windows machines, MacOS, or Linux subsystems.
* It is not offically maintained as of August of 2019, but a fork was used as a base for the creation of this cybersecurity excercise.

## üíª Virtual Machine Usage.

* Due to this project involving the use of multiple computers at once, I decided to utilize Virtual Machines. 

 * **This Project REQUIRED the use of Two Virtual Machines.**
 * They were:
1. Kali Linux, with the additional installiation of PowerShell-Empire. It can be found HERE: 
   * https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms
2. Windows 7 Professional Edition. (Since it is now discontinued and no longer supported by Microsoft, it can be obtained for free via Archive) It can be found HERE:
